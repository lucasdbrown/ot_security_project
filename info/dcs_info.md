# Distributed Control System (DCS)

## What is a DCS?
- A computerized control system for a process or plant usually with many control loops, in which autonomous controllers are distributed throughout the system, but there is no central operator supervisory control.

## How does this relate to SCADA?
- DCS is designed for large-scale industrial operations that involve multiple units and require centralized control, while SCADA is designed for smaller-scale processes that involve specific equipment or machines. 
- "SCADA systems and DCS are often networked together. This is the case for electric power
control centers and generation facilities. Although electric power generation facility operation is
controlled by a DCS, the DCS must communicate with the SCADA system to coordinate
production output with transmission and distribution demands." NIST SP 800-82
