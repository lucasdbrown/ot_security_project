# SCADA

- a SCADA collects data from sensors and based on its firmware makes decisions based on that.

## Simulators
SCADASim: A SCADA simulator that can be installed using Python

## What is connected to a SCADA???
- Remote Terminal Units (RTUs)
- Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs): PLCs communicate with the SCADA system to provide data on process variables (e.g., temperature, pressure) and to receive commands for controlling equipment.
- Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs): HMIs are directly connected to the SCADA system, displaying process data and enabling operators to issue commands to field devices via the SCADA network.
- Sensors and Actuators: Sensors and actuators are connected to RTUs or PLCs, which then relay data to and receive commands from the SCADA system.
- Data Acquisition Systems Data acquisition systems interface with SCADA through communication protocols to transmit collected data for real-time monitoring and analysis.
- Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs): IEDs communicate with the SCADA system to report electrical system status, fault conditions, and to execute automated protective actions.
- Alarm Systems: Alarms are generated based on data from sensors, RTUs, and PLCs, and are managed and displayed through the SCADA system.
