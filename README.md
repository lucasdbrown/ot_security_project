## Programmable Logical Controller (PLC)
- we used the `pymodbus` library to simulate the functions of a real PLC

## Human Machine Interface (HMI)
- used Flask in Python to simulate the functions of an HMI to control the functions of the sensor and actuator

## Water Sensor
- simulated the functions of a water sensor using Flask in Python

## Actuator
- simulated the functions of an actuator using Flask in Python
