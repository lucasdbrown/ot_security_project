# How would a hacker penetrate a SCADA
Overview: This file outlines the phases of how a hacker would infiltrate a SCADA

## Phase 1 - Recon
1. Network Scanning: Identify the IP addresses and services running on the SCADA network.
2. Service Enumeration: Determine the specific SCADA software and versions in use, including any associated protocols (e.g., Modbus, DNP3).
3. Vulnerability Research: Research known vulnerabilities for the identified SCADA software and hardware.
4. Social Engineering: Gather information about the organization and its employees to find potential entry points for phishing or social engineering attacks.

## Phase 2 - Access
1. Phishing and Social Engineering: Use phishing emails or social engineering tactics to obtain login credentials or introduce malware.
2. Exploitation of Remote Access: Exploit weaknesses in remote access services (e.g., weak passwords, unpatched software) to gain entry.
3. Network Exploitation: Exploit network vulnerabilities, such as open ports or misconfigured firewalls, to penetrate the network.
4. MITM: Can be used to intercept and manipulate communications between users and systems to gain unauthorized access. Attackers might intercept network traffic to steal credentials as they are transmitted over the network or to capture session tokens that can be used to impersonate legitimate users.

## Phase 3 - Escalation 


## Phase 4 - Manipulation
