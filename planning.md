Project 1: Simulating a Water Treatment Plant SCADA System Breach
Description: This project involves simulating a cyber-attack on a water treatment plant's SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system to assess and enhance its security posture. The simulation will help identify vulnerabilities, test incident response procedures, and develop mitigation strategies to protect against real-world attacks targeting water supply systems.

Objectives:

Understand common attack vectors targeting water treatment facilities.
Identify and assess vulnerabilities within the SCADA system.
Develop and test intrusion detection mechanisms specific to water treatment operations.
Create and refine an incident response and recovery plan.
Enhance overall security measures to protect against future threats.
