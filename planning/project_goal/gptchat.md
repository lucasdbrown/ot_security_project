Project 1: Simulating a Water Treatment Plant SCADA System Breach
Description: This project involves simulating a cyber-attack on a water treatment plant's SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system to assess and enhance its security posture. The simulation will help identify vulnerabilities, test incident response procedures, and develop mitigation strategies to protect against real-world attacks targeting water supply systems.

Objectives:

Understand common attack vectors targeting water treatment facilities.
Identify and assess vulnerabilities within the SCADA system.
Develop and test intrusion detection mechanisms specific to water treatment operations.
Create and refine an incident response and recovery plan.
Enhance overall security measures to protect against future threats.


1. Initial Planning and Research
Define Objectives:

Establish the goals of the simulation, such as identifying vulnerabilities, testing incident response, and developing mitigation strategies.
Define the scope, including which parts of the SCADA system will be simulated and tested.
Research Historical Attacks:

Study previous cyber-attacks on water treatment facilities (e.g., the Oldsmar, Florida water treatment attack).
Identify common vulnerabilities and attack vectors in SCADA systems.
2. Environment Setup
Design the Simulation Environment:

Use virtualization platforms (e.g., VMware, VirtualBox) to create a controlled environment simulating a water treatment plant.
Set up the network infrastructure, including PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers), HMI (Human-Machine Interface), sensors, actuators, and the SCADA system.
SCADA System Setup:

Implement a SCADA system using software like Rapid SCADA, Ignition, or similar tools that allow for realistic simulations.
Configure communication protocols commonly used in SCADA environments, such as Modbus, DNP3, and OPC UA.
Baseline Configuration:

Perform a baseline assessment of the SCADA systemâ€™s security, documenting current configurations, open ports, and network traffic patterns.
Establish normal operational baselines for future comparison during the attack simulation.
3. Threat Modeling
Identify Threats:

Create a list of potential threats based on the research phase, such as unauthorized remote access, manipulation of chemical dosing, data exfiltration, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
Risk Assessment:

Evaluate the impact and likelihood of each identified threat scenario.
Prioritize threats based on potential harm to the water treatment process and public safety.
4. Attack Simulation
Simulate Attacks:

Credential Theft: Simulate an attack where credentials are stolen through phishing or brute-force attacks, allowing unauthorized access to the SCADA system.
Data Manipulation: Simulate altering chemical dosing values or water levels within the SCADA system to create unsafe water conditions.
Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attack: Simulate a DoS attack to disrupt communication between PLCs and the SCADA system.
Monitoring During the Attack:

Use network monitoring tools like Wireshark and Snort to capture and analyze network traffic during the attack simulations.
Log all activities and changes made during the attack to understand the impact on the SCADA system.
5. Security Enhancement
Implement Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):

Set up IDS/IPS tools (e.g., Snort, Suricata) tailored to OT environments to detect unusual activity or unauthorized access attempts.
Configure alerts for specific attack signatures relevant to SCADA environments.
Harden the SCADA System:

Apply security measures such as disabling unnecessary services, changing default credentials, and enforcing least privilege access controls.
Implement encryption for communication between SCADA components to prevent data interception.
Develop Incident Response Plan:

Create a comprehensive incident response plan outlining steps for detecting, containing, and mitigating the effects of a cyber-attack.
Include communication protocols, roles and responsibilities, and a recovery strategy in the plan.
6. Validation and Testing
Retest with Enhanced Security:

Rerun the attack simulations to validate the effectiveness of the implemented security measures and incident response plan.
Identify any remaining vulnerabilities or areas for improvement.
Conduct Red Team/Blue Team Exercises:

Organize Red Team exercises where security professionals attempt to breach the system using advanced tactics.
Have the Blue Team (defenders) apply the incident response plan in real-time, simulating a real-world attack scenario.
