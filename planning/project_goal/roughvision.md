# Building the Project

1. Create phases for how a hacker might attack
2. Create scenarios based on these phases
3. Use environment to show how the infiltration may occur

4.a. Work on proof-of-concept tool to identify threat and remediate threat

4.b. Make a UI to show the possible exploits of different devices connected to the SCADA or the SCADA itself.

4.c. Develop risk methodology for devices and incident response methodology (use MITRE ICS Matrices?)
